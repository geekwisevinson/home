        This Page and all the Pages it links to are strictly informational and educational.
    </p>
    <p>
        The plan is to make small pages that teach me one or two specific areas of interest so that I understand more completely my job.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the top a few choice will be made available giving different paths to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, will be a tutorial starting from the beginning in an order that makes sense to me.
        I will cover what I know til this point (HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Mean(Mongo, Express, Angular, Node), React).
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, will be Static example pages. These pages that are fully functional on Github.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third, will be example pages that are external due to Github restrictions.
        These pages that are not fully functional on Github.
